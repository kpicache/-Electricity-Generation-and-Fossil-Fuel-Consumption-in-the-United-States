# -Electricity-Generation-and-Fossil-Fuel-Consumption-in-the-United-States

Project overview

Goal
This project aims to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced electricity generation
and fossil fuel consumption in the United States by analyzing the data from the EIA-923
database for the years 2019 and 2020.
Here are the two main questions being addressed throughout this project:
1. How did regional electricity generation and fossil fuel consumption efficiency (fuel used
per MWh) change across U.S. states between 2019 and 2020, based on EIA-923 data?
2. Which U.S. states showed the largest year-over-year change in fossil fuel consumption
per MWh of electricity generated between 2019 and 2020, and how does this correlate
with population density or lockdown stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Source: US Energy Information and Administration Electric Power and Fossil Fuel Data from
the EIA-923 database

Years Used: 2019 and 2020
Size: Each CSV file has approximately 15,000 records
Dataset
In this project, I will use the US Energy Information and Administration Electric Power and Fossil
Fuel Data from the EIA-923 database. This dataset spans from 1970 to 2023 and includes
monthly and annual reports from over 12,000 power plants. It details electricity generation, fossil
fuel consumption, fuel cost and quality, and plant operational data
